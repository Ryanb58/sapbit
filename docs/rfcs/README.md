# Remote Function Calls (RFCs)

This section provides comprehensive documentation on SAP Remote Function Calls (RFCs), which are essential for system integration and remote communication in SAP environments.

## What are RFCs?

Remote Function Calls (RFCs) are SAP's mechanism for communication between SAP systems or between SAP and non-SAP systems. They allow programs to call and execute function modules on remote systems, enabling distributed processing and system integration.

## Key Concepts

### RFC Types

- **Synchronous RFC (sRFC)**: The calling program waits until the called function is executed completely.
- **Asynchronous RFC (aRFC)**: The calling program continues execution without waiting for the called function to complete.
- **Transactional RFC (tRFC)**: Ensures that a function module is executed exactly once on the target system, even in case of communication failures.
- **Queued RFC (qRFC)**: Similar to tRFC but with additional queue management to control the sequence of execution.
- **Bgd RFC (bgRFC)**: Background RFC, an enhanced version of qRFC with improved performance and monitoring capabilities.

### RFC-Enabled Function Modules

Function modules must be specifically designated as "RFC-enabled" to be called remotely. This requires:

- Setting the "Remote-Enabled Module" attribute
- Proper parameter typing and handling
- Appropriate exception management

## Documentation Sections

### [Standard RFCs](./standard.md)

Documentation on standard RFC-enabled function modules provided by SAP. These are ready-to-use functions for common integration scenarios.

### [Custom RFCs](./custom.md)

Guidelines and examples for creating custom RFC-enabled function modules for specific business requirements.

## Common Use Cases

- System-to-system data exchange
- Integration with third-party applications
- Distributed processing across multiple SAP systems
- Batch data processing
- Real-time data synchronization

## RFC Security

RFCs can pose security risks if not properly managed. Key security considerations include:

- Authorization checks for RFC users
- Secure storage of RFC destination credentials
- Network security for RFC communication
- Regular auditing of RFC usage

## Best Practices

- Implement proper error handling in RFC-enabled function modules
- Use transaction RFCs (tRFC/qRFC) for critical business processes
- Monitor RFC execution with transaction SM58
- Document RFC interfaces thoroughly
- Test RFC connections before production deployment

## Tools for RFC Management

- **SM59**: RFC Destinations Configuration
- **SM58**: Asynchronous RFC Error Log
- **RSARFCSE**: RFC Security Analysis
- **RSRFCCHK**: RFC Consistency Check
