# SAP Objects

This section provides comprehensive documentation on various SAP objects that form the foundation of SAP systems.

## What are SAP Objects?

SAP objects are the building blocks of SAP systems. They include various technical elements such as transaction codes, tables, function modules, and more. Understanding these objects is essential for developers, consultants, and administrators working with SAP systems.

## Types of SAP Objects

### [Transaction Codes](./transaction-codes.md)

Transaction codes (T-codes) are short codes used to access specific functions in SAP systems. They provide quick access to various SAP transactions, reports, and utilities.

### [Tables](./tables.md)

Tables are database objects that store SAP data. Each table has a specific structure with defined fields and is used to store particular types of information within the SAP system.

### [Function Modules](./function-modules.md)

Function modules are ABAP programs that encapsulate reusable functionality. They can be called from other ABAP programs and provide a modular approach to SAP development.

### [Data Elements](./data-elements.md)

Data elements define the technical attributes of fields in SAP tables and structures. They specify properties such as data type, length, and field labels.

### [Domains](./domains.md)

Domains define the value range for data elements. They specify the technical properties of a field, such as data type and length, and can include value tables for validation.

### [IMG Activities](./img-activities.md)

Implementation Guide (IMG) activities are configuration steps used during SAP implementation. They guide users through the process of customizing SAP systems to meet specific business requirements.

### [Table Clusters and Pools](./table-clusters.md)

Table clusters and pools are special types of tables in SAP that group related data together for performance optimization.
